# Problem1
We loaded the required dataset for problem1.
```{r}

data("early_january_weather")
```
Then we listed all variables in this dataset, calculated the size of this dataset and the mean temperature.

```{r}
names(early_january_weather) #listed all variables in dataset
nrow(early_january_weather) #number of rows
ncol(early_january_weather) #number of columns
mean(early_january_weather$temp) #mean temperature
```
The `early_january_weather dataset` has 15 variables: `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, `visib`, `time_hour`. 
The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.
