We started by loading required libraries.

``` r

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# Problem1

We loaded the required dataset for problem1.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Then we listed all variables in this dataset, calculated the size of
this dataset and the mean temperature.

``` r
names(early_january_weather) #listed all variables in dataset
```

    ##  [1] "origin"     "year"       "month"      "day"        "hour"      
    ##  [6] "temp"       "dewp"       "humid"      "wind_dir"   "wind_speed"
    ## [11] "wind_gust"  "precip"     "pressure"   "visib"      "time_hour"

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather) #number of rows
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather) #number of columns
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
mean(early_january_weather$temp) #mean temperature
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

The `early_january_weather dataset` has 15 variables: `origin`, `year`,
`month`, `day`, `hour`, `temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`,
`wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, `visib`, `time_hour`.
The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns. The mean temperarture of early
January is 39.58212 Fahrenheit.

Then we plot the scatterplot of temperature vs time.

``` r
p1_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Temperature vs Time (in hours)",
       x = "Time (in hours)",
       y = "Temperature",
       color = "Humidity")
p1_plot
```

![](p8105_hw1_lg3450_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("temp_vs_time_hour.png", plot = p1_plot)
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

The scatterplot shows that temperature fluctuates across the hours of
the day over early January, generally ranging from about 25 to 50
degrees Fahrenheit.Higher humidity values (lighter blue points) occur
more often at higher temperatures, while lower humidity values (darker
blue points) occur at lower temperatures, indicating a positive
relationship between temperature and humidity over time.
